# guessing-game-project

This project creates a guessing game in the terminal, where you will pick a minimum number, a maximum number, and an amount of guesses. The program will randomly pick a number between the minimum and maximum numbers you inputted, and you will have the amount of guesses you entered to choose the correct number. Good luck!
